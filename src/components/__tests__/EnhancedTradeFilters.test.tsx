/**
 * EnhancedTradeFilters Component Test Plan
 * 
 * This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the EnhancedTradeFilters component.
 */

/**
 * UNIT TESTS
 * 
 * 1. Component Rendering
 *    - Verify that the component renders the "Trade Filters" heading
 *    - Verify that the "Show Filters" button is displayed by default
 *    - Verify that filter options are hidden initially
 * 
 * 2. State Management
 *    - Test that clicking "Show Filters" toggles the dropdown visibility
 *    - Test that clicking outside the dropdown closes it
 *    - Test that the "Apply Filters" button closes the dropdown
 * 
 * 3. Filter Functionality
 *    - Test that each filter type updates the filter criteria correctly
 *    - Test that selecting options from dropdowns works properly
 *    - Test that numeric inputs for ranges work correctly
 *    - Test that date pickers work correctly
 * 
 * 4. Active Filters Display
 *    - Verify that active filters are displayed as badges
 *    - Verify that each badge has a remove button
 *    - Test that clicking remove buttons clears individual filters
 *    - Test that "Clear Filters" button resets all filters
 * 
 * 5. Performance
 *    - Verify that the component doesn't re-render unnecessarily
 *    - Test that large lists of options don't cause performance issues
 *    - Verify that the dropdown scroll works for many filter options
 */

/**
 * INTEGRATION TESTS
 * 
 * 1. Filter Propagation
 *    - Test that filter changes are correctly passed to the parent component
 *    - Verify that the onFiltersChange callback is called with correct data
 *    - Test that multiple filter combinations work together
 * 
 * 2. Data Consistency
 *    - Verify that filter options are correctly derived from trade data
 *    - Test that min/max values are calculated correctly
 *    - Ensure that unique values are properly extracted for dropdowns
 */

/**
 * USER ACCEPTANCE TESTS
 * 
 * 1. Usability
 *    - Verify that the filter dropdown is easy to open and close
 *    - Test that all filter options are clearly labeled
 *    - Ensure that the active filters display is intuitive
 *    - Confirm that the UI is responsive on different screen sizes
 * 
 * 2. Accessibility
 *    - Test keyboard navigation through filter options
 *    - Verify that screen readers can access filter controls
 *    - Ensure proper focus management when opening/closing dropdown
 *    - Test color contrast for filter badges and controls
 * 
 * 3. User Workflow
 *    - Test applying multiple filters in sequence
 *    - Verify that filters can be incrementally added/removed
 *    - Confirm that the "Clear Filters" button works as expected
 *    - Test that the "Apply Filters" button provides clear feedback
 */

/**
 * EDGE CASE TESTS
 * 
 * 1. Empty States
 *    - Test behavior when no trades are provided
 *    - Verify handling of trades with missing data
 *    - Test with trades that have no unique values for dropdowns
 * 
 * 2. Boundary Conditions
 *    - Test with extreme min/max values
 *    - Verify behavior with identical from/to dates
 *    - Test with very large trade datasets
 * 
 * 3. Error Handling
 *    - Test with malformed trade data
 *    - Verify graceful handling of invalid dates
 *    - Test behavior when onFiltersChange callback is undefined
 */

/**
 * PERFORMANCE TESTS
 * 
 * 1. Render Performance
 *    - Measure rendering time with different trade dataset sizes
 *    - Test memory usage with many active filters
 *    - Verify that dropdown opening/closing is instantaneous
 * 
 * 2. Interaction Performance
 *    - Measure filter application speed
 *    - Test responsiveness when rapidly changing filters
 *    - Verify that UI remains responsive during filtering
 */

/**
 * CROSS-BROWSER TESTS
 * 
 * 1. Browser Compatibility
 *    - Test on latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
 *    - Verify consistent appearance across browsers
 *    - Test touch interactions on mobile browsers
 * 
 * 2. Device Compatibility
 *    - Test on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
 *    - Verify responsive layout adjustments
 *    - Test orientation changes on mobile devices
 */

/**
 * USAGE EXAMPLES
 * 
 * Basic Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * <EnhancedTradeFilters 
 *   trades={trades} 
 *   onFiltersChange={handleFiltersChange} 
 * />
 * ```
 * 
 * The component expects:
 * - trades: Array of Trade objects to derive filter options
 * - onFiltersChange: Callback function to receive filter updates
 * 
 * The component provides:
 * - Interactive filter dropdown with multiple filter types
 * - Visual display of active filters
 * - Responsive design for all screen sizes
 * - Accessible controls for all users
